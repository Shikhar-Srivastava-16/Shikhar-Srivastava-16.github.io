            <p> 
                This is a <i>Cryptex</i> as depicted in <i>The Da Vinci's Code</i>. Both the movie and the book have depictions of a combination-lock safe, which is in reality fictional, but attributed by the characters in the book and the movie to Leonardo da Vinci. The lock works by working rotating the dials in order to find the combination. For the correct combination, the internal cylinder can be slid out of the lock, giving access to whatever is inside. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The design is scalable and tilable - meaning that this design can be made as large as possible and with as many locking pins as possible.

            <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 2rem; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="../assets/fully-aligned.png" alt="Description of photo 3" style="width: 200px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <p> 
                In the unlocked state, the channels which let the locking pins slide through each component are all lined up, which allows the internal barrel to slide out of the lock
            </p>
            <hr>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 2rem; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="../assets/one-locked.png" alt="Description of photo 6" style="width: 200px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <p> 
                This is a <i>Cryptex</i> in the locked state - here, cylinder 3 has been moved out of the unlocked state. This means that there is a physical barrier in front of and behind the third locking pin, which keeps the inner barrel in place and keeps it from sliding outwards.
