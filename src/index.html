            <h2>The Cryptex</h2>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 2rem; justify-content: center;">
                <img src="../assets/cross-section.png" alt="cross-section" style="width: 20em; height: auto;">

            </div>
            <p> 
                This is a <i>Cryptex</i>, as depicted in <i>The Da Vinci's Code</i> by american mystery author Dan Brown. Both the movie and the book have depictions of a combination-lock safe, which is in reality fictional, but attributed by the characters in the book and the movie to Leonardo da Vinci. The lock works by working rotating the dials in order to find the combination. For the correct combination, the internal cylinder can be slid out of the lock, giving access to whatever is inside. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The design is scalable and tilable - meaning that this design can be made as large as possible and with as many locking pins as possible.
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 2rem; justify-content: center;">
                <img src="../assets/fully-aligned-cross.png" alt="fully-aligned-cross" style="width: 200px; height: auto;">
                <img src="../assets/fully-aligned.png" alt="fully-aligned" style="width: 200px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <p> 
                In the unlocked state, the channels which let the locking pins slide through each component are all lined up, which allows the internal barrel to slide out of the lock
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 2rem; justify-content: center;">
                <img src="../assets/one-locked-cross.png" alt="one-locked-cross" style="width: 200px; height: auto;">
                <img src="../assets/one-locked.png" alt="one-locked" style="width: 200px; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <p> 
                This is a <i>Cryptex</i> in the locked state - here, cylinder 3 has been moved out of the unlocked state. This means that there is a physical barrier in front of and behind the third locking pin, which keeps the inner barrel in place and keeps it from sliding outwards.

        <p>
            One of my special interests for a very long time has been photography - specifically, I have pursued wildlife photography and birding in a number of regions across the world, but mostly in North-Western India and in the Himalayan Mountain Range. I have also photographed some of the most inhospitable, and thus in my mind the most beautiful regions on Earth. The Middle and Upper Himalayas - some of the least accessible regions on the planet occupy a special place in both my picture gallery and in my heart. I have sought out some of the most impressive and beautiful architecture in the world, capturing everything from castles, nestled in the heart of Scotland to 1000-year old temples hidden away from the cosmopolitan world, accessible only by foot. Look through just a small selection of these images in the following section.
